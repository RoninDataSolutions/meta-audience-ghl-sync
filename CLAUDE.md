# Project Instructions

## Security Rules
- NEVER read, cat, or access the `.env` file. It contains live secrets.
- NEVER print, log, or include any API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials in responses.
- When auditing for secrets, check `.gitignore` coverage and `.env.example` — do NOT read `.env` itself.
- If a user shares credentials in chat, remind them to rotate after the session.
